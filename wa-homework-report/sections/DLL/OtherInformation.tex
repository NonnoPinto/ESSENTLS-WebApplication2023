\subsection{Other Information}

Here some information about minor entities and relations.\\
\textbf{Tags} and \textbf{Causes} are two entities that are used to classify events. Every ESN event
supports at least one cause, such as rising founds, meeting freshman etc.
and can be tagged as school, party, cinema etc. These two entities are used to filter events, in order to help users finding what fits most their interests.\\
\textbf{EventTag}, \textbf{EventCauses}, \textbf{R1} and \textbf{R2} are relations without attributes, used
only to join tables.
