\textbf{Tags} and \textbf{Causes} are two entities that are used to classify events. Every ESN event
supports at least one cause, such as %TODO: some cause examples!
and can be tagged as %TODO: some tag examples!
. These two entities are used to filter events, in order to hel users to find what fits most their interests.\\
\textbf{EventTag}, \textbf{EventCauses}, \textbf{R1} and \textbf{R2} are relations without attributes, used
only to join tables.
