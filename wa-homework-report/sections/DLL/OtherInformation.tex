\subsection{Other Information}

Here is some information about minor entities and relations.\\
\textbf{Tags} and \textbf{Causes} are two entities that are used to classify events. Every ESN event
supports at least one cause, such as rising founds, meeting freshman, etc.
and can be tagged as school, party, cinema, etc. These two entities are used to filter events, to help users find what fits their interests.\\
\textbf{EventTag}, \textbf{EventCauses}, \textbf{R1} and \textbf{R2} are relations without attributes, used
only to join tables.
