\section{Main Functionalities}
%What are the main functionalities of the web app? what services does it offer and how it is organized?

Main functionalities are intended to facilitate users and event management, besides a stronger database.
Above the list of functionalities asked by a group member, who's also an active volunteer in ESN Padua.
After discussing them  with the group, we listed these goals for the web abb.

\subsection{Database}
\lipsum[1]
\subsection{User Management}
Users should be able to create a new account autonomously and confirm it via email. Also
applying for ESN Card should be done without paper (as it's done at the moment), filling all necessary
information for membership remotely, saved automatically in the database.\\
Furthermore, users would have a tiered system of participation, avoiding non eligible users to enter ESN events. Italian
speaking users needs to be volunteer to participate ESN events, since they also give access to conventions with many businesses.\\
%What about a graphic representation of tiers, with duties and benefits?

\subsection{Event Management}
The final project should allow administrators to manage events easier, controlling participants, events
details such as general information but eventually also causes supported by the event.\\
With a better database, it should be possible to create statistics about events,
such as number of participants,visibility, causes supported, etc.\\
