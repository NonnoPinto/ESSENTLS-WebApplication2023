\section{Objectives}
%Brief description of the overall objectives of your system.
%What your system will be used for? Why is it important? What problems does it solve?

This project is intended to be a Web App that will be used by
\href{https://padova.esn.it/}{ESN Padova}, an active section of \href{https://esn.it/}{ESN Italia}.
It would help them to streamline and facilitate tasks of
registering members and maintaining a membership list different every year (currently made by volunteers).
The use of a web application would then likely increase the visibility of its events to international students
and make it easier to register for events organized by ESN Padua, just from their smartphones.\\
Furthermore. that allows volunteers to
manage events and Erasmus students, since there is the opportunity to join some events
only if youâ€™re a member of ESN Padova (that corresponds in getting an ESNcard and pay a fee).
%this is just, rearrnaged, what i found on trello. Next, i find usefull
%to add few more specific objectives, altought they will be more detailed in the next section.
