%Brief description of the overall objectives of your system.
%What your system will be used for? Why is it important? What problems does it solve?

This project is intended to be a Web App that will be used by
{https://padova.esn.it/}ESN Padova, an active section of \href{https://padova.esn.it/}{ESN Italia}.
It would help them to streamline and facilitate tasks of
registering members and maintaining a membership list different every year (currently made by volunteers).
The use of a web application would then likely increase the visibility of its events to international students
and make it easier to register for events organized by ESN Padua, just from their smartphones.\\
Furthermore, that allows volunteers to
manage events and Erasmus students, since there is the opportunity to join some events
only if you’re a member of ESN Padova (that corresponds to getting an ESN card and paying a fee).\\
At the moment, the subscription is made with a paper form, the payment is by cash or POS and the overall database is a spreadsheet.
Events are managed by a communication manager, who posts them on Instagram, the website, and the Facebook group. Mainly former platforms.\\
As a result, this is a very time-consuming process, that requires a lot of effort from volunteers
and, what is more, it is not very efficient.\\
The overall goal is to facilitate the process and build a stronger database.
