# Getting Started

Below a list of steps to follow in order to run the ESN Padova Web Application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

On your machine you must have installed:

* Apache Tomcat
* Maven
* PostgreSQL/pgAdmin 4

## Configuring the Database

1. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://your_username@bitbucket.org/upd-dei-stud-prj/essentls.git
    ```

2. Open pgAdmin 4 and create a new database named: `essentls`

   &nbsp;

   ![createDB](/readme_assets/createDB.png)

   &nbsp;

   ![nameDB](/readme_assets/nameDB.png)

   &nbsp;

3. Restore the database from the `ESSENTLSDB.sql` file. You can find this file inside the cloned repo following this path: `essentls/proj/src/main/db/ESSENTLSDB.sql`

   &nbsp;

   ![restoreDB](/readme_assets/restoreDB.png)

   &nbsp;

   ![fileDB](/readme_assets/fileDB.png)

   &nbsp;

4. Create a new user in pgAdmin 4 called `essentls` with password `essentls`. (See the [alternative](#markdown-header-alternative) if you don't want to create a new user)

   &nbsp;

   ![createUserDB](/readme_assets/createUserDB.png)

   &nbsp;

   ![nameUserDB](/readme_assets/nameUserDB.png)

   &nbsp;

   ![passwordUserDB](/readme_assets/passwordUserDB.png)

   &nbsp;

   ![privilegesUserDB](/readme_assets/privilegesUserDB.png)

   &nbsp;

5. Set the ownership of the `essentls` database to `essentls` user.

   &nbsp;

   ![proprietiesDB](/readme_assets/proprietiesDB.png)

   &nbsp;

   ![ownerDB](/readme_assets/ownerDB.png)

   &nbsp;

### Alternative

4. Follow the previous steps (from 1 to 3)

5. Modify the `context.xml` file inside `essentls/proj/src/main/webapp/META-INF/` by putting your postgres `username`, `password` and `port` in the corresponding field.

    ```
You can find the compiled `.war` file in `essentls/proj/target`

# Run the application

1. Startup your local version of Apache Tomcat

2. Open Tomcat manager at: `http://localhost:8080/manager/html`. (change the port number to match your configuration)

3. Deploy the `.war` file in `essentls/proj/target` generated in the building phase

4. Start the app by clicking on the link
